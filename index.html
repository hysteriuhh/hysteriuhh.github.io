          Student & Entrepreneur at Western University, interested in sales, finance, and building brands.
        </p>

        <p>
          I’m a third-year student at Western University, studying political science and focusing on how
          people, incentives, and institutions actually work in the real world. Outside class, I’ve been
          running clothing and sneaker resale businesses, designing streetwear, and chasing opportunities
          in sales and finance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Recently I’ve been exploring roles in private wealth, sales rotational programs, and business
          development — anything that mixes people, numbers, and strategy. I care a lot about learning
          fast, building genuine relationships, and creating things that people actually want.
        </p>

        <h2>What I’m working on</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Growing my clothing and sneaker resale ventures.</li>
          <li>Building a portfolio of content around conversation, mindset, and personal growth.</li>
          <li>Preparing for internships in sales, finance, and consulting.</li>
        </ul>
